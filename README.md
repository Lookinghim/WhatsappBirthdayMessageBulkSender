## Configuration

1. Open `config.py` and update the following variables:

## Usage

1. Ensure you're logged into WhatsApp Web in your Chrome profile before running the script.

```plaintext
python whatsapp_automation.py
```


3. The script will run continuously, executing the scheduled task daily at the specified time.
4. To stop the script, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running.


## Important Notes

- Keep your computer on and the script running for the scheduled task to work.
- Do not interact with the Chrome window while the script is sending messages.
- The script uses your existing WhatsApp Web session, so make sure you're logged in.
- Messages will only be sent to contacts whose birthday matches the current date.
- Ensure your Excel file is always up-to-date with the correct information.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Chrome visibility problems:

1. Run the `test_chrome_visibility.py` script to check if Chrome is working correctly with Selenium.
2. Ensure ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version.



2. WhatsApp Web not loading:

1. Check your internet connection.
2. Verify that you're logged into WhatsApp Web in the specified Chrome profile.



3. Messages not sending:

1. Double-check the phone numbers in your Excel file, ensuring they include the country code.
2. Verify that the Excel file is not open in another program while the script is running.



4. Script crashes or stops unexpectedly:

1. Check the log file for error messages.
2. Ensure all required packages are installed correctly.
3. Verify that your Chrome profile path is correct in the `config.py` file.



5. Scheduled task not running:

1. Make sure your computer doesn't go to sleep at the scheduled time.
2. Check that the `SCHEDULED_TIME` in `config.py` is set correctly.





If problems persist, try the following:

- Clear your Chrome browser cache and cookies.
